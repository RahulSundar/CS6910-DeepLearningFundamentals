#Fashion MNIST classification using a "numpy" Bare Bones Feed forward Neural Network

This folder contains the code base for Assignment 1 as part of CS6910: Deep Learning Fundamentals course at IIT Madras during the Spring of 2021.

The problem statement involves building and training a 'plain vanilla' Feed Forward Neural Network from scratch using primarily Numpy package in Python.  

The code base now has the following features:
1. Forward and backward propagation are hard coded using Matrix operations. The weights and biases are stored separately as dictionaries to go hand in hand with the notation used in class.
2. A neural network class to instantiate the neural network object for specified set of hyperparameters, namely the number of layers, hidden neurons, activation function, optimizer, weight decay,etc.
3. The optimisers, activations and their gradients are passed through dictionaries configured as attributed within the FeedForwardNeuralNetwork class. 
4. Activation functions are defined separately in the utility/activations.py file. 
5. A colab notebook containing the entire code to train and validate the model from scratch.
